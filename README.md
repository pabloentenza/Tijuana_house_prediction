# Tijuana_house_prediction
The current project involves the prediction of the price of house in Tijuana, Mexico. Here, we use three algortihms: Ridge, Lasso and XGboost to train the data. This task results important due to the inmigration from California to Tijuana and thus the price tends to increase.
